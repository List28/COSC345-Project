# COSC345-Project

## Description
- The COSC345 project is a semester long project that is built using "two or more publicly available data sets (on different topics) that can be combined to add meaning to something, and build an app that uses that combined data for the betterment of the user or society".

## Our App
- Our idea for the app is to make public information about MPs published on the parliament website easily viewable and searchable to the public. With the purpose of making people more informed about who they’re voting for especially in regards to the upcoming election.
